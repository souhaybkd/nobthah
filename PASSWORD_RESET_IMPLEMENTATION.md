## 🔧 Appwrite Configuration Required

### **IMPORTANT: You must configure the following in Appwrite Console**

#### Step 1: Add Platform URLs (CRITICAL - Required for Security)
⚠️ **Appwrite only accepts redirect URLs from domains added as platforms**

1. **Go to Appwrite Console** → Your Project → **Overview** → **Platforms**
2. **Add a Web Platform**:
   - Click "Add Platform" → "Web App"
   - **Name**: Your App Name (e.g., "Nobthah")
   - **Hostname**: 
     - For Development: `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`)
     - For Production: `your-domain.com` (without https://)
   - Click "Save"

**Example:**
```
Development:
- Name: Nobthah Local
- Hostname: localhost

Production:
- Name: Nobthah Production
- Hostname: nobthah.com
```

#### Step 2: Configure Email Service
1. **Go to Appwrite Console** → Your Project → **Settings** → **SMTP**
2. **Configure SMTP Settings**:
   - Enable custom SMTP or use Appwrite's default
   - Test email delivery

#### Step 3: Email Template (Optional but Recommended)
1. **Go to Appwrite Console** → Your Project → **Auth** → **Templates**
2. **Customize Password Recovery Email**:
   - Edit the email subject and body
   - Use `{{redirect}}` variable for the reset link
   - Customize branding and messaging

### Reset URL Format
The system automatically generates the correct reset URL:
- Arabic: `http://yourdomain.com/reset-password`
- English: `http://yourdomain.com/en/reset-password`

Appwrite will append: `?userId=xxx&secret=xxx&expire=xxx`

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

- ✅ Same border style (5px solid black)
- ✅ Same box shadow (15px 15px)
- ✅ Same background image on left panel
- ✅ Same button hover effects
- ✅ Same responsive breakpoints
- ✅ Same toast notification style
- ✅ Same input field styling
- ✅ Fully mobile responsive

## 📝 API Endpoints Used

### Appwrite SDK Methods:
1. `account.createRecovery({ email, url })`
   - Sends password reset email with reset link
   - The `url` parameter is where users will be redirected
   - Must match a domain added as a platform in Appwrite
   - Used in ForgotPassword pages

2. `account.updateRecovery({ userId, secret, password })`
   - Updates password with reset token from email
   - `userId` and `secret` come from URL query parameters
   - Token is valid for 1 hour
   - Used in ResetPassword pages

## 🚀 Next Steps (IMPORTANT!)

### 1. **Add Platform URL in Appwrite** (REQUIRED - DO THIS FIRST):
   ⚠️ **Without this, password reset will NOT work!**
   
   - Go to Appwrite Console → Your Project → Overview → Platforms
   - Add Web Platform with your domain/hostname
   - For localhost: use `localhost` as hostname
   - For production: use your domain (e.g., `nobthah.com`)

### 2. **Configure Email Service** (Required):
   - Ensure SMTP is configured in Appwrite
   - Test that emails are being delivered

### 3. **Test the Flow** (Recommended):
   - Test with real email addresses
   - Verify emails are received
   - Click reset link and test complete flow
   - Test both Arabic and English versions

### 4. **Customize Email Template** (Optional):
   - Edit email template in Appwrite Console
   - Add your branding
   - Customize messaging

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The reset link expires after a certain time (configured in Appwrite, default 1 hour)
- Users must use the reset link before it expires
- Only works with registered email addresses
- Requires proper SMTP configuration in Appwrite
- Reset tokens are single-use only

## 🎉 Complete!

Your password reset flow is now fully implemented and ready to use. Just configure Appwrite and test!

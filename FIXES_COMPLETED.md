## 🚀 **WHAT YOU NEED TO DO**

### 1. **Google Fonts Import (OPTIONAL)**
If you want to use the Inter font properly, add this to your `index.html` or main CSS:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

**OR** just rely on system fonts (already done with fallbacks):
```css
font-family: 'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
```

### 2. **Test Each Template**
- Load each template with real data
- Check print preview
- Verify colors look good
- Test PDF generation

### 3. **Complete Remaining Templates**
Would you like me to finish:

Just say "continue with the remaining templates" and I'll complete them!

#### 1. **Payment Provider Integration**
- **Provider**: LemonSqueezy
- **Store ID**: 96692
- **Variant ID**: 427561
- **API Key**: Configured (hardcoded - needs environment variable)
- **Status**: ⚠️ **DISABLED FOR TESTING**

#### 2. **User Label System**
- **Purpose**: Track which templates users have paid for
- **Storage**: Appwrite user labels array

- **Status**: ✅ **Working**

#### 3. **Webhook Handler**

Check if user.labels includes template ID
  ↓
If YES → Allow download (Print PDF)

```

## ❌ What's Missing / Broken:

### 🔴 **CRITICAL ISSUES:**

#### 1. **Payment Flow is Completely Disabled**
**Location**: `Resume.tsx` (both Arabic & English versions)
- Lines 271-306 (Arabic) / 269-308 (English)
- Payment code is commented out with `/* PAYMENT CODE DISABLED FOR TESTING */`
- **Current Behavior**: All users can download any template for free
- **Expected Behavior**: Should redirect to LemonSqueezy checkout

#### 2. **No Payment Page Route**
**Issue**: App.jsx has commented route:
```javascript
// <Route path="/payment" element={<Payment />} />
```
- **Missing**: Payment component doesn't exist
- **Impact**: No custom payment page implementation

#### 3. **Security Issues**

##### API Key Exposure:
```javascript
// HARDCODED API KEY in Resume.tsx (both versions)
API_KEY: "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9..." // 🔴 EXPOSED!
```
- **Risk**: Anyone can see your API key in browser
- **Solution Needed**: Move to environment variables

##### Webhook Secret Exposure:
```javascript
// webhooks/main.js line 8
.setKey('3e92ef56f3209b...') // 🔴 EXPOSED!
```
- **Risk**: Exposed in repository
- **Solution Needed**: Use environment variables

#### 4. **Missing Payment Success/Failure Pages**
- **No Success Page**: After payment, where do users land?
- **No Failure Page**: What happens if payment fails?
- **No Processing Page**: No "verifying payment..." state

#### 5. **Incomplete Webhook Setup**
**Current Issues**:
- Hard-coded project ID and API key
- No webhook signature verification (security risk)
- No error handling for duplicate payments
- No logging/monitoring for failed webhooks

#### 6. **Missing User Experience Features**

##### Before Payment:
- ❌ No payment preview modal
- ❌ No "what you'll get" summary
- ❌ No price display before checkout
- ❌ No terms & conditions acceptance

##### During Payment:
- ❌ No loading state while creating checkout
- ❌ No "redirecting to payment..." message
- ❌ No ability to cancel/go back

##### After Payment:
- ❌ No confirmation email automation
- ❌ No success message in app
- ❌ No automatic redirect to resume after payment
- ❌ No receipt/invoice generation

#### 7. **Missing Payment Features**

##### No Payment History:
- Users can't see what they paid for
- No transaction history
- No payment dates
- No download/view receipts

##### No Refund System:
- No refund request flow
- No refund policy display (only in Terms)
- No admin panel to process refunds

##### No Multiple Template Purchase:
- Current: One template = one payment
- Missing: Buy multiple templates at once
- Missing: Bundle pricing options

#### 8. **Missing Admin Features**
- ❌ No admin dashboard
- ❌ No payment analytics
- ❌ No failed payment tracking
- ❌ No revenue reports
- ❌ No user payment status overview

#### 9. **Missing Error Handling**

##### Webhook Failures:
- What if webhook never arrives?
- What if user pays but label isn't added?
- No manual verification option

##### Payment Failures:
- No retry mechanism
- No "contact support" option
- No error logging for debugging

##### Network Issues:
- What if LemonSqueezy API is down?
- No fallback payment method

#### 10. **Missing Testing Infrastructure**
- ❌ No test mode configuration

## 🎯 Current Payment Flow (When Enabled):

```
1. User creates resume
   ↓
2. User clicks "Download Resume"
   ↓
3. System checks: Does user.labels include template ID?
   ↓
4A. IF YES (Already Paid):
    → Display resume
    → Trigger PDF print/download
    → Done ✅
   ↓
4B. IF NO (Not Paid):
    → Create LemonSqueezy checkout
    → Get checkout URL
    → Redirect user to LemonSqueezy payment page
    ↓
5. User completes payment on LemonSqueezy
   ↓
6. LemonSqueezy sends webhook to your server
   ↓
7. Webhook handler:
    → Receives order data
    → Extracts user email & template ID
    → Finds user in Appwrite by email
    → Adds template ID to user.labels
    → Returns success
    ↓
8. User is redirected back to app (???)
   ↓
9. ??? What happens here? 🤔
```
